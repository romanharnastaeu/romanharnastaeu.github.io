# 🚀 Interactive CV

A single-page, interactive CV that presents my profile, projects, skills, and achievements as a modern web experience instead of a static résumé. It’s designed to feel like a polished product rather than just a template.

The page highlights my work in full‑stack development, backend systems, and Web3 through real projects (Telegram bot framework, React mini app, mobile app, TON ecosystem tools) and clearly structured skills and core competencies.

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses custom animations, responsive layouts, and light data-driven UI to showcase both my technical abilities and how I think about developer experience and presentation.
